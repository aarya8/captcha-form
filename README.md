Verification: The user must enter the correct code to access the website page or function.
# Project Workflow
1. Design the webpage layout and structure using HTML and CSS.
2. Use JavaScript to generate a random code consisting of a combination of numbers and letters using the Math.random() function.
3. Display the CAPTCHA code on the webpage.
4. Add a refresh button to allow the user to generate a new CAPTCHA code if they are having difficulty reading the current code.
# Conclusion:
The Simple CAPTCHA App with Random Code Generation project provides a simple solution to protect websites and applications from automated bots. By generating a random code and requiring the user to input it correctly, the app can differentiate between humans and automated bots. The app is easy to use, mobile-friendly, and effective in preventing automated attacks.
